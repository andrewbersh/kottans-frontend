## Linux CLI and Networking
Learned a lot of new linux commands and figured out how to use some old in different way.
Finally, I understand how "|" works.

Read about HTTP protocol, together with new cli commands it will be really useful even
on my current job as system engineer.

## Git Collaboration
This material was really challenging. On my mind, it's really difficult to understand
such details of git without practice, so I'm looking forward to use new commands in 
the future.
